The goal is to obtain the QA-automation specialty. I plan to reach a basic level of Java and learn to work in such frameworks as Selenium. This is relevant for me, because I want to develop myself and acquire new skills compatible with my profession, and I also want to try myself at programming. The term for achieving the goal - the duration of the course - 4 months.
